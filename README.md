# Wallet Template

Wallet Template is a simple desktop GUI application built with JavaFX, that shows you how 
to put together a basic Bitcoin wallet. As the name implies, it's also meant to be a quick
base on which to start new projects by just copying the code. As an example, 
[Lighthouse](https://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse) was started by copying and adapting this
code, as were a few other apps.

This repository is a lightly modified mirror of the wallet-template module in the bitcoinj 
source code. Once 0.13 is out it will be synced and then synced again with each new upstream
release. If you fork it, you should be able to merge or rebase onto new code as it improves.
